                    Dealers generally will do their best to match the vehicle you have configured on Motor Nest,
                    but many times they will not have an exact match for the car you are looking to purchase.
                    This is not the dealer's fault, but rather a challenge with the way cars and trucks are manufactured
                    and marketed.
                    While some vehicles are produced in large numbers, other vehicles are produced in smaller numbers.
                    To further complicate things, many options or colors will be produced in even more limited
                    combinations.
                    This creates a great deal of confusion for buyers that want a very specific configuration.
                    Ultimately this can affect your expectations when contacting a dealer,
                    so it may be helpful to keep an open mind about what the dealer may be offering as an alternative.

                    The Motor Nest Price Rating helps you easily recognize a fair price for a vehicle similar to the one
                    you want. The ratings are based on recent listing prices for similar vehicles in your area.

                <h4> Why is Motor Nest's Factory Invoice often higher than the Invoice Price I see on other sites? </h4>

                    Often, manufacturers charge the dealer not only a Destination Charge, but also some additional fees
                    such as extra freight fees, admin fees, fuel charges, and the most typical of all, Regional Ad Fees.
                    Regional Ad Fees is the cost a manufacturer allocates for advertising and promoting the vehicle in
                    the dealer's market. For example, all Toyota dealers pay Regional Ad Fees. These extra fees, like
                    Destination Charges, are a legitimate cost to the dealer and should be added to the Factory Invoice.
                    As a matter of fact, many dealers won't call it out but simply make them part of the Factory Invoice
                    (which could make you believe the dealer is artificially inflating the price, especially when
                    comparing the Factory Invoice found on other web sites). Motor Nest includes these Regional Ad Fees
                    and
                    other extra fees, and the curious minds can always see the precise breakdown in our Table tab. This
                    is, however, not a catch all. Taxes, title, license, registration, dealer documentation,
                    after-market accessories, dealer installed options, etc. are costs added by the dealer (instead of
                    the manufacturer) and are as such not part of the Factory Invoice.

                    We are committed to keeping our data up-to-date and accurate. When a vehicle has a very small
                    history of recent purchases, it's difficult to provide reliable price ranges. We believe that not
                    showing a Price Report is a better approach than suggesting or making an interpretation of the
                    price.

                    Usually, you will need the current registration for the vehicle signed by all registered owners,
                    along with the car title and your ID or driver’s license. You may also need to provide warranty
                    information. To complete your sale transaction, you will likely need to complete a bill of sale.
                    Check with your local DMV to confirm what you’ll need in your state.

                    Yes. Before going to a dealership, contact the lienholder (usually a bank or finance company) to get
                    a payoff quote for the vehicle, and note the payee address for the dealership to send the payoff
                    amount to.
